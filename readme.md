* An app to help people collect data for science measurments to broaden involvement.
* Accomplishment Database and App - Having the ability to "check" completing meetings and tasks within Google Calendar and get a weekly summary report based on a given time frame to get a list of accomplishments. The purpose of this is to help people see what they accomplished so they can appreciate what they have done.
