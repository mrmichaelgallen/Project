# The challenge with this exercise/program is that it is not exact, because it should be using your birthdate - current date to determine the exact days, minutes and seconds you lived

import datetime
print("Let's see how long you have in days, minutes and seconds.")
name = input("What is your name: ")
birthdate = date.year(input("What is your birth date? Example 1900,01,01: "))
today = datetime.today()
daysAlive = timedelta.days
print(daysAlive)
